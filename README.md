# TooLazyForMaths
A bunch of python scripts that automate mathematical equations/functions
<br>
# tlfm.py
All functions in one file which can quickly be imported
<br>
# General purpose
prime_numbers.py returns a list of prime numbers within 0 and a given ceiling.
<br>
# Graphing
midpoint.py finds the midport between two coordinates in the cartesian plane.

distance.py finds the distance between two coordinates in the cartesian plane.

linear_equation.py calculates y depending on what x is for multiple values.

quadradic_equation.py returns 2 lists, x and y which are results of a quadradic function. 

log.py is like quadradic_equation.py but a log function.
<br>
# Geometry
area.py has multiple functions to calculate the area of several shapes
volume.py is is similar to area.py but for 3D shapes
<br>
# Trigonometry
<br>
find_side_with_sides.py finds any side using the other 2 sides of a triangle
find_side_with_angle_side.py finds any side using any other side and angle
find_angle_with_sides.py finds any angle using 2 sides
