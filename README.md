# distance.py
distance.py finds the distance between two coordinates in the cartesian plane.

# linear_equation.py
linear_equation.py calculates y depending on what x is for multiple values.

# quadradic_equation.py
like linear_equation.py but quadradic

# all_logs.py
like quadradic_equation.py but a log function.

# area.py
area.py has multiple functions to calculate the area of several shapes

# volume.py
volume.py is is similar to area.py but for 3D shapes
