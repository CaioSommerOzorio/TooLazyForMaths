# TooLazyForMaths
A bunch of python scripts that automate mathematical equations/functions


# Graphing

midpoint.py
midpoint.py finds the midport between two coordinates in the cartesian plane.

distance.py
distance.py finds the distance between two coordinates in the cartesian plane.

linear_equation.py
linear_equation.py calculates y depending on what x is for multiple values.

quadradic_equation.py
like linear_equation.py but quadradic

log.py
like quadradic_equation.py but a log function.

# Geometry

area.py
area.py has multiple functions to calculate the area of several shapes

volume.py
volume.py is is similar to area.py but for 3D shapes

# Trigonometry

pythagoras.py
pythagoas.py finds any side using the other 2 sides of a triangle

find_side_with_angle.py
find_side_with_angle.py finds any side using any other side and angle

find_angle_with_sides.py
find_angle_with_sides.py finds any angle using 2 sides


# Todo
- Finish find_side_with_angle.py
- find_angle_with_side.py
